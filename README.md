## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

-   **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   **npm**: Comes with Node.js

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files manually):**
    ```bash
    # If you get this from GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/786-ali-dev/react-todo-app.git
    cd react-todo-app
    ```
    (If you are manually creating the files, ensure they are in the correct directories as shown in the Project Structure above.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building the App

To build the app for production to the `build` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

This correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
